API - Generic Classes
=====================

.. module:: gpiozero.devices

.. currentmodule:: gpiozero

The GPIO Zero class hierarchy is quite extensive. It contains several base
classes (most of which are documented in their corresponding chapters):

* :class:`Device` is the root of the hierarchy, implementing base functionality
  like :meth:`~Device.close` and context manager handlers.

* :class:`GPIODevice` represents individual devices that attach to a single
  GPIO pin

* :class:`SPIDevice` represents devices that communicate over an SPI interface
  (implemented as four GPIO pins)

* :class:`InternalDevice` represents devices that are entirely internal to
  the Pi (usually operating system related services)

* :class:`CompositeDevice` represents devices composed of multiple other
  devices like HATs

There are also several `mixin classes`_ for adding important functionality
at numerous points in the hierarchy, which is illustrated below (mixin classes
are represented in purple, while abstract classes are shaded lighter):
