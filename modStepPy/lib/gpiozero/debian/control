Description: Simple API for controlling devices attached to a Pi's GPIO pins.
 gpiozero builds on various pin libraries to provide a set of classes designed
 to simplify interaction with devices connected to the GPIO pins, from simple
 buttons and LEDs, up to various add-on boards. The API tries to adhere closely
 to Python's idioms and naming conventions, and features alternative
 programming paradigm approaches.
